## A Tropical Themed Brick Breaking Game

This game was created by a friend and me back in high school.  It is built in Blitz3D, which is now available as an open source IDE [here](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitz3d).

The goal of the game is to break all of the bricks (treasure chests) using the ball (coconut) as fast as you can to get the most points without losing all of your lives.  The velocity of the ball can be adjusted slightly by moving the paddle as you hit the ball.
